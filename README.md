# Hi there, I’m Jonas 👋

#### In my 8+ year career, I experienced significant professional growth, advancing from Junior PHP Developer to Mid-Level/Senior Full-Stack Developer. At this specialized company in branded merchandise and distribution, I took on a broad role within the e-commerce development team. The team focused on the rapid implementation and professional management of large-scale B2B and B2C webshops, with bespoke solutions at the core of its services.

As a full-stack developer, "manusje-van-alles" as I would say in dutch, I specialize in transforming ideas into high-quality, maintainable, and scalable code. I excel in defining developer requirements and specifications, collaborating with creative and development teams to bring ideas and projects to life.

I’m passionate about driving innovation and process improvements, regularly promoting new technologies and best practices to enhance team efficiency and deliver exceptional user experiences. My work focuses on creating responsive, cross-browser-compatible solutions that meet modern standards.

My technical expertise includes HTML, Javascript, CSS (SCSS), PHP (Laravel), and a range of cutting-edge technologies such as Vue, Nuxt, Livewire, and Magento E-commerce. With a strong foundation in both design translation and backend integration, I bring a comprehensive approach to building robust and dynamic web applications.
